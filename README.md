# CapsLock Arrows

This is an AutoHotKey script that maps navigational keys the way I like them on keyboards that don't support QMK.  I got this from the internet somewhere, but can't find it again.  If you're the owner please let me know so I can add attribution.

Maps:

| Shortcut                         | Output                           |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| CAPSLOCK + { w, a, s, d }        | { Up, Left, Down, Right }        |
| CAPSLOCK + { q, e }              | { Home, End }                    |
| CAPSLOCK + { r, f }              | { PageUp, PageDown }             |
| CAPSLOCK + { i, j, k, l }        | { Up, Left, Down, Right }        |
| CAPSLOCK + { u, o }              | { Home, End }                    |
| CAPSLOCK + { y, h }              | { PageUp, PageDown }             |

## Compiling and Running

Install AutoHotKey, then right-click on the `.ahk` file and choose "Compile". This will produce an `.exe` of the same name. Run it to apply the mapping.
